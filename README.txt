This is the fourth project in Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Program
It implements Q-Learning Algorithm for an agent to find its way from a atarting point to a destination

There are four python files:
(1) agent.py:
	- Implements the q-learning algorithm and runs the simulation
(2) environment.py:
	- Creates the environment (traffic lights, routes, agents etc) where the primary agent finds its way from starting point to destination
(3) simulator.py
	- Updates the GUI of the game and call updates at every time frame
(4) planner.py
	- Finds a simple route from start to destination for the primary agent

images directory keeps icons for the dummy and primary agents on the game
