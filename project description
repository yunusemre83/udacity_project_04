Train a Smartcab to Drive

A smartcab is a self-driving car from the not-so-distant future that ferries people from one arbitrary location to another. In this project, you will use reinforcement learning to train a smartcab how to drive.

Environment

Your smartcab operates in an idealized grid-like city, with roads going North-South and East-West. Other vehicles may be present on the roads, but no pedestrians. There is a traffic light at each intersection that can be in one of two states: North-South open or East-West open.

US right-of-way rules apply: On a green light, you can turn left only if there is no oncoming traffic at the intersection coming straight. On a red light, you can turn right if there is no oncoming traffic turning left or traffic from the left going straight.

To understand how to correctly yield to oncoming traffic when turning left, you may refer to this official driversâ€™ education video, or this passionate exposition.

Inputs

Assume that a higher-level planner assigns a route to the smartcab, splitting it into waypoints at each intersection. And time in this world is quantized. At any instant, the smartcab is at some intersection. Therefore, the next waypoint is always either one block straight ahead, one block left, one block right, one block back or exactly there (reached the destination).

The smartcab only has an egocentric view of the intersection it is currently at (sorry, no accurate GPS, no global location). It is able to sense whether the traffic light is green for its direction of movement (heading), and whether there is a car at the intersection on each of the incoming roadways (and which direction they are trying to go).

In addition to this, each trip has an associated timer that counts down every time step. If the timer is at 0 and the destination has not been reached, the trip is over, and a new one may start.
